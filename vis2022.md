<!--
In this Application Spotlight, we will focus on audio-visual analytics and its (potential) applications.
Visualization and sonification are two approaches for conveying data to humans based on complementary
high-bandwidth information processing systems and both address the purpose of involving humans in data analysis.
Although extensive research has been carried out both on the auditory and visual representation of data,
comparatively little is known about their systematic and complementary combination for data analysis.
Existing research on combinations has often focused only on one of the modalities.
However, there are potentially powerful synergies in combining both modalities to address the individual limitations of each one.
Inspired by existing applications such as in health promotion and rehabilitation
and solutions such as the Highcharts Sonification Studio,
we will discuss the potential of audio-visual analysis tools.
We will have 3 invited talks and an open discussion with the audience.
With this Application Spotlight our goal is to build and strengthen a community of members
from the sonification and the visualization communities that are interested in combining the two modalities.
We believe that in the long term, establishing bridges between the communities will have a positive impact
on both disciplines separately as well as on multi-modal data analysis methods.
