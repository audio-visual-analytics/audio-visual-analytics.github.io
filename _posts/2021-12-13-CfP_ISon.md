We would like to share the [Call for Papers for the Interactive Sonification workshop (ISon)](https://interactive-sonification.org/ISon2022), taking place in September 2022. Interactive Sonification is the specialized research topic concerned with the use of sound to portray data, but where there is a person at the heart of an interactive control loop. The main theme of ISon 2022 is Psychoacoustics in the Loop and will highlight how these two fields of research can benefit from one another.
