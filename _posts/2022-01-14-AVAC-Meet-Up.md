We are inviting you to our **first informal AVAC Meet-Up on the 25th of January at 6 pm (Vienna)** via Zoom.
 
The Audio-Visual-Analytics Community (AVAC) is a young international community, interested in the combination of information visualization and sonification. The AVAC Meet-Up is a format we want to establish as a regular virtual meeting for our young community, to discuss ideas and projects of our members. We aim for one meeting every second month, lasting about 1,5 or 2 hours each. 

**Program:** 
We will listen to two presentations: One by Victor Schetinger (TU Vienna) and one by Elias Elmquist (Linköping University).
We scheduled ~15-minute presentations and 30-45 minutes for questions and discussions. We will use Zoom to meet virtually. 

Victor will tell us about his project „Xenakis: Experimenting With Data, Cities, and Sounds,“ that he also presented at the alt.VIS workshop at IEEE VIS 2021 ([Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.14992.pdf) & [Miro Board](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_l47ltks=/?moveToWidget=3074457361915360658&cot=14)). 

Elias will give insights into his project „Open Space Sonification: Complementing Visualization of the Solar System with Sound,“ which was awarded the best academic use of sound award and the best student paper award at ICAD 2021 ([Paper](https://icad2021.icad.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ICAD_2021_18.pdf)).
