In June 2022, members of the Audio Visual Analytics community gathered at the [AVI 2022 Workshop](/avi2022.html) in Frascati near Rome, Italy.

After that, some of them extended their stay in Italia by attending the [Eurographics Conference on Visualization](https://conferences.eg.org/eurovis2022/).
