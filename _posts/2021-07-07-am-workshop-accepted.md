Yesterday, the AudioMostly accepted our workshop proposal.
There will be two workshops on Audio-Visual Analytics in autumn 2021,
which exposes the topic to both the sonification and the visualization communities.

The AudioMostly is an interdisciplinary conference on design and experience of interaction with sound and held in cooperation with ACM SIGCHI.

AudioMostly 2021 will be held [virtually](https://audiomostly.com/2021/news/2/) from 1-3 September 2021.
The Audio-Visual Analytics workshop will take place on [3 September 2021](https://audiomostly.com/2021/info/important-dates/).
