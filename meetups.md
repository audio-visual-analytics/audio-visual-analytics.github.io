The Audio-Visual-Analytics Community (AVAC) is a young international community, interested in the combination of information visualization and sonification. The AVAC Meet-Up is a format we want to establish as a regular virtual meeting for our young community, to discuss ideas and projects of our members. We aim for one meeting every second month, lasting about 1.5 or 2 hours each.
