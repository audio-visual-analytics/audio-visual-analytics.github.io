# About the Workshop

In their daily lives, people use more than one sense to perceive and interpret their environment. Therefore, we think designing audio-visual interfaces will help human analysts understand their data even better in the future. The 3rd Workshop on Audio-Visual Analytics continues building a community (AVAC) of researchers interested in combining information visualization and sonification. The first two workshops were held interactively at the Audio Mostly 2021 and the IEEE VIS 2021 conferences. The third edition at AVI 2022 will be the first one with the possibility to submit short papers or position papers.

The workshop is part of the [International Conference on Advanced Visual Interfaces (AVI)](https://sites.google.com/di.uniroma1.it/avi2022/home).

# Call for Participation and Submission

The workshop encourages the submission of short papers or position papers addressing the workshop theme and the list of topics below. Submitted papers should discuss both visual and auditory representations of data to be interpreted by humans. Ideally, the contribution can be categorized to one of the following topics: Theory, Tools, Evaluation, Design, and Accessibility. 

All papers must be original and not simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference. The following paper categories are welcome:

- Short papers describe work in progress with respect to the workshop focus.
- Position papers are problem discussions or statements describing the author's relevant experience and ideas in regards to methods and methodologies for visualization and sonification research, and in particular the focus topic of the workshop.

<!-- **Preliminary format details/can still be subject of change:** -->
Position papers and short papers should be 2-4 pages long with additional pages for references only and prepared according to two-column CEUR-ART template:
- [LaTeX template on Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/hstqmwtnzxqv) *(hint: [copy project using the menu](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/Copying_a_project#Making_a_copy_of_a_project))*
- [LaTeX template as a ZIP file](https://www.dropbox.com/s/b31nbskiagedsl6/CEUR-Template-2col-WAVA22.zip?dl=0)
- [MS Word template](https://www.dropbox.com/s/acql4g2at5w7wt7/CEUR-Template-2col-WAVA22.docx?dl=0)

Please submit your paper at <https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wava22>.
