No registration fee is needed for participation in the workshop.
There is no call for papers and no selection procedure for participation in this workshop due to its interactive format.

The Audio-Visual Analytics workshop will be a fully remote, virtual event due to the continuing COVID-19 pandemic and in alignment with the [decision not to host a physical meeting for Audio Mostly 2021](https://audiomostly.com/2021/news/2/).

## Outcomes

The workshop and its [follow-up event at IEEE VIS](vis2021) are planned as the kick-off event to work on a follow-up publication on the research agenda discussed in the workshop.
This follow-up publication will be authored by a self-selected subset of workshop participants and organizers.
It can be a journal article (e.g., in IEEE TVCG) or an edited book (e.g., Morgan & Claypool Synthesis Lectures on Visualization).
