There is no call for papers and no selection procedure for participation in this workshop due to its interactive format.

The Audio-Visual Analytics workshop will be a fully remote, virtual event due to the continuing COVID-19 pandemic and in alignment with the [decision not to host a physical meeting for Audio Mostly 2021](https://audiomostly.com/2021/news/2/).

## Outcomes

The workshop and its [follow-up event at IEEE VIS](vis2021) are planned as the kick-off event to work on a follow-up publication on the research agenda discussed in the workshop.
This follow-up publication will be authored by a self-selected subset of workshop participants and organizers.
It can be a journal article (e.g., in IEEE TVCG) or an edited book (e.g., Morgan & Claypool Synthesis Lectures on Visualization).
